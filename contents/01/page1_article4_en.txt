## "Quota exceeded" error fix
ㅤ
While using the API, did you suddenly see the [[purple:"Quota exceeded"]] error message?
Don’t panic.
It’s a very common issue, and there’s a perfect fix.
ㅤ
## Assess the current situation
Your API key is currently in a 24-hour cooldown. But you don’t have to just wait!

## Solution 1.
ㅤ
This is the simplest and most effective method.
Google places few restrictions on sign-ups.
So you can [[purple: create multiple Google accounts and issue an API key for each]].
ㅤ
## Practical use.
1. [[purple: Issue API keys with 3–5 Google accounts]] in advance and keep them ready
2. [[purple: When the first key hits its limit, switch to the second key]]
3. Rotate them using a rotation system
ㅤ
## First, secure as many API keys as possible.
ㅤ
API Key 1 (main.account@gmail.com) - ABCDEFG...
API Key 2 (backup.account@gmail.com) - ABCDEFG...
API Key 3 (extra.account@gmail.com) - ABCDEFG...
Store the keys like this and rotate them.

This way you can use it without limits.
Write them down in a note like the image below and rotate them.
The more keys you have, the better.

## Solution 2.

Adjusting your API quota usage is also an important strategy.
Simply narrowing your search scope can save a lot of quota.

[[purple:Inefficient approach (avoid)]]
- Search across all countries
- Set an unnecessarily wide range
- Request too much data at once
ㅤ
[[purple:Efficient approach (recommended)]]
- Select only the needed countries (only target countries like Korea, US, Japan)
- Search sequentially by region
- Request only the data you truly need
