##See global trends at a glance

The biggest advantage of VIDHUNT is that it shows you [[purple: global Shorts by automatically converting your keyword into each country's language]] all at once.
For example, if you search 'cat,' it aggregates results in various languages like 'cat,' 'gato,' '고양이,' and '猫' and shows them together.
This way, you won’t miss overseas viral content that hasn’t been discovered domestically yet.

##Leverage the traits of the YouTube algorithm

YouTube’s algorithm gives priority exposure to [[purple: videos on similar topics to content that is "currently" trending]].
Therefore, when producing a video or choosing a topic, it’s important to identify the core elements that are most popular right now within your channel’s category.

##Timing is the key to success

Here’s an important tip.
YouTube values [[purple: a 100K-view video uploaded yesterday more than a 1M-view video from three months ago]].
So set your search window as short as possible. We recommend narrowing it to 7 days, or even 3 days, and producing Shorts in a planned way.
For older hit videos, there’s a high chance many creators have already made similar content.
If you jump in late, the algorithm is less likely to prioritize your video.
