I searched just once!
Did you see the API quota exceeded error message?
I’ll tell you why.

[[purple: The more countries you search, the more quota the API uses]].
If you selected all countries when searching,
you’re sending API requests to a total of 82 countries, which consumes a significant amount of quota.

So try reducing the number of countries you search.

## There’s plenty of quota left in Google Console, but I got an error.

This happens very frequently.
Because API quota usage isn’t reflected in real time,
it’s highly likely that [[purple:The Google Console view may not yet reflect the latest usage]].

## The most reliable solution
## is to use a new API key.

To find effective viral Shorts,
[[purple: always prepare multiple API keys in advance.]]

Google allows you to create unlimited Gmail accounts,
and each Gmail account can receive its own API key.
In other words, you can secure [[purple: as many API keys as you need]].

Go ahead and issue API keys with multiple Gmail accounts right now and organize them in a note.
