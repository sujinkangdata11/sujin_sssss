Google API? What is that? Many of you are probably hearing this for the first time, but don‚Äôt worry! 

"Do I have to pay?" ‚Üí No, [[purple:it‚Äôs completely free.]]
"Do I need a credit card?" ‚Üí [[purple:Not at all.]]
"Is it hard?" ‚Üí [[purple:Even a 10-year-old can do it.]]

Google Gemini API is a free service provided by Google.

For example, if you create an `ABC @gmail.com` account,
Google provides that account with "free AI features."
[[purple:Simply put, it‚Äôs one of Google‚Äôs free AI services!]]
