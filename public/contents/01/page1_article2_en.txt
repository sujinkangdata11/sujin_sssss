Data API? What is that? Many of you are probably hearing this for the first time, but don’t worry! 

“Do I have to pay?” → No, [[purple:it’s completely free.]]
“Do I need a credit card?” → [[purple:Not at all.]]
“Is it hard?" → [[purple:Even a 10-year-old can do it.]]

YouTube Data API v3 is a free service provided by Google.

For example, if you create an `ABC @gmail.com` account, 
Google grants that account “permission to query YouTube data.”
[[purple:Simply put, it’s one of Google’s free services!]]
