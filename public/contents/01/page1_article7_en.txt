##API key security notice
Your API key is safe

Many people ask about API key security,
so weâ€™d like to clearly explain our serviceâ€™s security policy.

##ðŸ”’ Our serviceâ€™s security principles

[[purple:API key non-storage policy]]
* We do not store your API key on our servers
* All data is cleared when the session ends
* No personal data collection due to no sign-up.

[[purple: Cache not used policy]]
* No server-side cache storage
* Only temporary, browser-session-based usage is allowed

[[purple: ðŸ’¡ About browser auto-fill ]]
If your API key appears to auto-fill or seem saved,
this is due to your Chrome browserâ€™s autosave feature.

[[purple: Solutions ]]
1. Browser settings: disable auto-fill
2. Clear cache: delete browser cache and cookies
3. Incognito mode: use the service in private mode


We protect your valuable information with robust security policies.
API keys are used only to process requests and are never used for any other purpose.

Security is our top priority.
