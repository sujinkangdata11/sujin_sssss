##ðŸ”’ Our Serviceâ€™s Security Principles

[[purple: API Key Non-Storage Principle]]
* Your API key is neither transmitted to nor stored on our servers.
* The API key is used only temporarily in browser memory and is deleted upon page refresh or tab closure.
* Because there is no sign-up/login, we do not collect or retain personally identifying information on our servers.

[[purple: No Server-Side Storage & Browser Storage Notice]]
* We do not use server-side databases/sessions/server caches.
* Only non-sensitive information for service convenience (e.g., language settings, view state) is stored in the browserâ€™s local storage and remains until cleared by the browser.
* Sensitive information such as API keys is not stored in local/session storage or cookies

[[purple: ðŸ’¡ Browser Auto-fill Notice]]
In some cases, an API key may appear to be auto-filled or seem saved; this may be due to the auto-fill/password manager settings of the userâ€™s browser.

[[purple: How to Resolve ]]
1. Disable auto-fill/save features in your browser settings
2. Clear browser storage (localStorage/cache/cookies)
3. Use Incognito/Private Browsing mode

We strive to protect your information by implementing appropriate security measures.  
API keys are used solely for the purpose of processing requests, and as a matter of principle are not used for any other purpose.
